# TypeChat

TypeChat is a small experimental library for getting structured data from large language models using TypeScript types. 

TypeChat makes it easier to add a natural language interface to your app by taking care of structuring, parsing, and validating responses from AI models.

TypeChat bridges the approximate world of natural language with the precise world of software that takes action on systems of record using types. TypeChat gives you the ability to constrain the natural language input of a user to defined types, and ensure that the response returned LLM matches the user intent.

To get started with TypeChat, you can install it via npm.

```
npm install typechat
```
